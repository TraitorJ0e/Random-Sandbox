# RandomSandbox

Developed with Unreal Engine 5
A sandbox game inspired by Garry's Mod and other sandbox games. I'm a new game developer and this is my first real game. You can do things like spawn objects and characters and switch between multiple maps. This is in extremely early development and many features have not been refined or added yet.
